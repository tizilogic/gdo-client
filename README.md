# Garage Door Opener (client)

A Simple Kivy (Android) App to use with [gdo-server](https://github.com/tizilogic/gdo-server) to safely *(to the best
of my knowledge)* activate a GPIO pin on the server, that in my case opens my garage door.

## Build the APK:

I use [Kivy](https://kivy.org) together with [p4a-build-spaces](https://github.com/JonasT/p4a-build-spaces) to build
the APK... Step by step instructions will follow eventually.
